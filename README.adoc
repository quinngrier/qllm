This is Qllm, a large language model CLI wrapper.

Here's how to get started:

. Make sure you have the following tools installed:

.. Bash version 5.2.21 or later.
You can check this by running `bash --version`.

.. curl version 8.5.0 or later.
You can check this by running `curl --version`.

.. GNU Awk version 5.2.1 or later.
You can check this by running `gawk --version`.

.. For Vertex AI:

... Google Cloud SDK version 532.0.0 or later.
You can check this by running `gcloud --version`.

. Download the link:{x_download_url}[`qllm`] script and optionally put
it in your `PATH`.

. Set your `VISUAL` environment variable to your desired text editor.
For example, `export VISUAL=vim`.

. Optionally set your `VISUAL_BOTTOM` environment variable to the CLI
arguments needed to make your editor scroll to the last line when
opening a file.
For example, `export VISUAL_BOTTOM=+` or
`export VISUAL_BOTTOM='-c "normal G"'` will work for `vim`.

. For Vertex AI:

.. Make sure `gcloud` is configured such that running
`gcloud auth print-access-token` and `gcloud config get-value project`
output the right things.

. Run `qllm` to start or resume a chat session in `qllm.txt`.
Wait for your editor to open, type your input at the bottom, save the
file and close your editor, and repeat.
When you want to quit, close your editor without making any changes
(which is checked via hashing, not last-modified time).
