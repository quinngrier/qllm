qllm is a large language model CLI.

Here's how to get started:

. Make sure you have the following tools installed:

.. Bash version 5.0 or later.
You can check this by running `bash --version`.

.. curl version 8.5.0 or later.
You can check this by running `curl --version`.

.. GNU Awk version 5.2.1 or later.
You can check this by running `gawk --version`.

.. jq version 1.7 or later.
You can check this by running `jq --version`.

.. If you plan to use Vertex AI:

... Google Cloud SDK version 532.0.0 or later.
You can check this by running `gcloud --version`.

. Download the link:{x_download_url}[`qllm`] script and optionally put
it in your `PATH`.

. Set your `VISUAL` environment variable to your desired text editor.
For example, `export VISUAL=vim`.

. Optionally set your `VISUAL_BOTTOM` environment variable to the
arguments to pass to your text editor to make it scroll to the bottom
when opening a file.
For example, you can use `export VISUAL_BOTTOM=+` for Vim.

. If you plan to use Vertex AI:

.. Make sure `gcloud` is configured such that running
`gcloud auth print-access-token` and `gcloud config get-value project`
output the right things.

. Run `qllm` to start or resume a chat session in `default.qllm`.
Wait for your text editor to open, type your input at the bottom, save
the file and close your editor, and repeat.
When you want to quit, close your editor without making any changes
(which is checked via hashing, not last-modified time).
